<h1>THE<br />
<span class="smcap">New Jersey Law Journal</span><br />
PUBLISHED MONTHLY</h1>

<p class="volumedate">VOLUME XLV FEBRUARY, 1922 No. 2</p>

<h2>EDITORIAL NOTES.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Happily it is</span> not such a frequent occurrence as may be supposed that
the Judges of our Court of Errors and Appeals split apart so curiously as
they did in determining that the Van Ness Enforcement Act should be
declared unconstitutional. The result only shows that, like the doctors,
Judges cannot all think alike. On the subject of whether whiskey is useful
as a medicine or not our New Jersey doctors, on a canvass, split, 520
to 308, or 490 to 319, according as one interprets the replies. In the Nation
at large it ran 51 per cent. to 49 per cent., a closer margin. But only
half of those who were interrogated by the &#147;Journal of the American
Medical Association&#148; responded; what the rest thought we do not know.
So on the legal questions involved in the Van Ness Act, counting those
Judges who approved the Act as constitutional in the Supreme Court, the
difference between a yea and nay vote appears to have been only one. On
the subject of whether the Act could be sustained because it took away
from defendants the right of trial by jury, which was the great burden in
objections made by defendants themselves, the Court held what this Journal
has held, that the Legislature had the power to direct that trials might
be by magistrates without a jury. It had done so over and over again in
other matters and could do so in liquor legislation as well. On other points
there were various differences of opinion. However, since the Act as a
whole is declared unconstitutional, on the ground that it does not conform
to the Federal Act, which declares that the illegal possession, sale,
etc., of liquors constitute a crime, instead of disorderliness, the Legislature
has passed new statutes which alter the basis of a conviction from a disorderly
proceeding to a criminal proceeding. There is no hope in this for
bootleggers, except as it permits them to escape by jury disagreements or
&#147;not guilty&#148; verdicts. If no law were enacted the Federal Courts would
be filled with cases, and the results there would give no hope to criminals.
Generally speaking, the upsetting of the Van Ness Act is unfortunate, because
jury trials are expensive as well as uncertain; trials before Judges
as magistrates are more certain and far less expensive. In the end, however,
bootleggers will not win in the game.</p>

<p class="indent">On the question of the legality of &#147;picketing&#148; by strikes the Court of
Errors and Appeals of this State also held quite divergent views, but sustained
the Keuffel &amp; Esser injunction granted by Vice-Chancellor Buchanan
against the International Association of Machinists. The majority decision
of the Court was rendered on Jan. 26th, in an opinion by Mr. Justice
Swayze. His finding was sustained by 9 affirmative and 5 negative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
votes. Besides Justice Swayze, the members of the Court voting to affirm
were Justices Parker, Bergen, Kalisch and Katzenbach, and Judges White,
Williams, Gardner and Ackerson. Voting to reverse were Chief Justice
Gummere, Justices Trenchard, Minturn and Black and Judge Van Buskirk.
&#147;The object of the appeal avowedly is,&#148; said Justice Swayze, &#147;to
secure a decision as to the legality of picketing when unaccompanied with
violence, molestation of others, annoying language or conduct&mdash;in short,
what is sometimes called peaceful picketing. Parading in the neighborhood
of complainants with placards indicating that a strike is in progress
is similar in its legal character to picketing.&#148; He then pointed out that
the Court is bound in a measure by the recent decision of the Supreme
Court of the United States in the case of the American Steel Foundries v.
The Tri-City Central Trades Council, in which Chief Justice Taft wrote
an opinion upon the rights of strikers, both at common law and as governed
by the Clayton act. Taking the Federal decision as a foundation,
Justice Swayze said it held the employer had the right to the access of his
employ&#233;s to his place of business and of egress therefrom, without intimidation
or obstruction; and the employ&#233;s, recent or expectant, had the right
to use peaceable and lawful means to induce present employ&#233;s and would-be
employ&#233;s to join their ranks. He remarked that the legality of any particular
conduct depends on the facts of the particular case and that picketing
may or may not be lawful, as it has or has not an immediate tendency
to intimidate the other party to the controversy. Remarking that picketing
is illegal if it has an immediate tendency to obstruct free passage
such as the streets afford, consistent with the rights of others to enjoy the
same privilege, Justice Swayze continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Thus men may accost one another with a view of influencing action,
but may not resort to persistence, importunity, following and dogging.
The number of pickets may of itself make the picketing unlawful, since it
may amount to intimidation. Everyone knows that threats of bodily harm
may be made by a mere show of force, without violence of language or
breach of the peace, and that mere numbers may intimidate. The real
question is, &#145;Does the conduct under existing facts amount to intimidation?&#146;
Twenty-five or fifty pickets may, when a single picket probably would not.
If information alone were wanted in the pending case, all the information
necessary for the defendants to enable them to prosecute their efforts to
convert the complainants employ&#233;s would have been obtained by a few
men. The use of twenty-five or fifty or two hundred, as in fact used,
was clearly unnecessary, and could not have been intended for any lawful
purpose. In view of the testimony as to what actually went on, the Vice-Chancellor
properly held that the conduct of the defendants was an illegal
interference with the complainants&#146; property rights.&#148;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The opinion noted above is, in the whole, a lengthy one. Judge White
concurred in it in a separate opinion. Justice Minturn filed a strong dissenting
view, taking the ground that the Court&#146;s conclusion served to
mark another step in the cycle of judicial legislation, which, beginning with
an appropriate effort to curb agitation of a forcible character, has concluded
with an edict which will be construed to put an end to peaceable
and constitutional economic agitation. &#147;Nothing further,&#148; he said, &#147;would
seem to be necessary to complete the chaplet of judicial legislation, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
it be the invocation of the provisions of the statute of laborers (Edward
III.), under the provisions of which the laborer was effectually conscripted
to the service of the master, and to that end was hounded as a helot,
and labeled with the brand of Cain. In every other walk of life the peaceful
activities condemned by these adjudications are quiescently tolerated,
if not approving recognized.&#148;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The cash bonus asked&mdash;not asked but demanded in formal resolutions&mdash;by
various of the associations of the American Legion throughout
the country, and which has given the present Congress and the President
more concern than almost any domestic subject, has not struck a responsive
chord in the popular ear except from the soldiers&mdash;a minority of
them, as we believe&mdash;who want it. Every business man knows it is not
the time to pension well soldiers of the late war further than the States
are doing it. We have always doubted that the best officers and soldiers
of the country were behind the movement. It is to belittle their patriotism
to believe that they desire to foist billions of taxes, direct or indirect, upon
their country at the present moment.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">When Senator Edge told an assembly at Atlantic City recently that
the Senate of the United States, of which he is a member, failed alarmingly
in performing its proper duties in a speedy and efficient manner, he
only stated what public opinion has long held. The mere fact, to which
he did not allude however, that a few men can talk any good project before
that body to death, the Senate rules permitting unlimited debate, has served
again and again to prove the truth of his statements. The House of Representatives,
with its too-many members, is far more reflective of public
sentiment than the Senate, and actually does its work more expeditiously
when a majority of members desire quick action. A reform in the Senate
is of such importance that too much public attention to its improper methods
of carrying on public business cannot be given. The press of the
country should be a unit in demanding a change in methods and results.
The New York &#147;Times&#148; thinks the trouble is largely due to the fact that
there is a dearth of strong men in the Senate; that there is no great inducement
for a strong man to go to the Senate as a new member, because
he is practically &#147;frozen out&#148; of any good committee assignment for a
long period of time. It says of a new member:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What will happen to him when he takes his seat in the Senate? He
will get only insignificant committee appointments. He will be expected to
be silent for at least six months. If he undertakes, as a new Senator, to
impress upon the Senate any positive convictions of his own, he will be
&#145;hazed&#146; like a college freshman in the effort to teach him his place. If
there is in the Senate a &#145;career open to talent,&#146; it is open only after long
waiting. In short, the Senate that now professes an anxiety for the accession
of strong men itself puts formidable obstacles in the way of a
strong man. Its rules, as Senator Wadsworth has just been lamenting,
make it almost impossible to transact business. Its time is mostly taken up
by querulous and ineffective members. Its committees are manned by the
rule of seniority, which too often spells senility. Indeed, about the only
way in which the Senate as it is at present can be said to be a nursery of
political strength is in accordance with the maxim, Suffer and be strong.
A Senator who can survive for a few years the suffering, mental and moral,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
which he has to undergo in the Senate, may emerge into power and
influence. But upon the strong man just arrived the Senate always puts a
damper.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Lots of truth in this. Nevertheless, present Senate rules combined
with too much politics and too little statesmanship and business activity
are responsible for a deterioration of the public esteem for our highest
governing body.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Dean Stone of the Columbia University Law School of New York
City in a report to the President of that Institution made recently sounds
a proper warning as to the quality and numbers of young men crowding
into the Bars of many of the States. Among other things he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It may well be doubted whether there is any profession which makes
greater demands than the law on the capacity of its members for sustained
intellectual efforts, their powers of discrimination and their ability to master
detail. Yet, as I have often had occasion to point out in these reports,
increasing numbers of men of mediocre ability and inadequate preliminary
education are being attracted to the law by the ever-increasing facilities
for law study. What, under the conditions of law study and admission to
the Bar of a generation ago, was a task of magnitude testing the patience,
stability, character and intellectual power of the prospective lawyer to the
utmost may now be performed with relative ease. This is partly attributable
to the multiplication of opportunities for law and study nicely
adapted to the peculiar type of Bar examination prevailing in most of our
States, and partly because Law Schools and Bar examinations too often
place the interests of the individual law student and sometimes their own
interests ahead of the interests of the profession. It is the duty of Law
Schools to dissuade the man of ordinary ability and meagre education
from beginning law study, and, if he will not be dissuaded, to apply to
him standards of proficiency and attainment worthy of the profession to
whose membership he aspires.&#148;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The Washington Conference is over and the results are more than
gratifying. Only the blindest obtuseness on the part of the United States
Senate has prevented early ratification of the various treaties made by it.
The great point gained by this Conference is that it brought Great Britain,
France, Japan, China and five other powers face to face in friendliest attitude,
and this is what should happen again when occasion calls for it.
Every country represented is happy over the result, and to say that America
should be is a truism. It marked another great event in world history.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Some day perhaps, every moving-picture theatre will have this
description of the art it employs on its front curtain, for is it not the
lucid description recently published in a magazine devoted to the &#147;sublime
art&#148; of motion-picture writing? And it will be good for school boys and
girls to interpret: &#147;The photodramatist enters the great cosmic drama
in keeping with the Infinite Plan; he will be, in the expanse of days to
come, a master of new values in art, science, philosophy, religion. From
the fastnesses of the invisible world of Thought, fulgurous forces of
the very essence of Beauty are sweeping into his consciousness, attracted
by the human desire for more complete expression.&#148;</p>

<h2>SOME REMINISCENCES, MOSTLY LEGAL.</h2>

<p class="center">BY HON. FREDERIC ADAMS, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p class="center">V. <span class="smcap">Some New Jersey Courts and Lawyers</span></p>

<p class="indent">In the early autumn of 1862, nearly sixty years ago, I became a law
student in the office of Amzi Dodd, in Newark. Mr. Dodd was then at
the best of his mental and physical strength. In his office I came
to know, admire and revere him, and there was begun a cordial friendship
between us which continued unbroken until he passed away in extreme
old age. I think that there was not in New Jersey a sounder legal
head than his, nor a better balanced and more sagacious legal judgment.
Nor was this all. He was profoundly ethical, not obtrusively but sensitively.
There was a voice within to which he always listened, and he
rested firmly on the fundamental morals which are part of the religion of
every good man and underlie the Law itself. Nor was this all, for to the
innermost recesses of his nature he was devoutly, rationally and serenely
Christian.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Dodd was a Princeton graduate and a contemporary of three remarkable
Rutgers men, Cortlandt Parker, Frederick T. Frelinghuysen and
Joseph P. Bradley, any one of whom would have conferred distinction on
any Bar in the country. Mr. Dodd, though a good and persuasive speaker,
had not the oratorical charm of Mr. Frelinghuysen, nor the forensic power
of Mr. Parker. He and Mr. Bradley had a good deal in common. Both
were scholarly, excellent mathematicians, and had the judicial stamp.</p>

<p class="indent">In my first year with Mr. Dodd I had an interesting experience. His
cousin, Chief Justice Edward W. Whelpley, came to Newark to hold the
Essex Circuit, pursuant, I suppose, to some arrangement with Judge Daniel
Haines. He was in the office almost every day, and I lost no opportunity
to attend Court and hear him try cases. He was an impressive figure,
a big man with a heavy voice and a commanding manner. I have sometimes
wondered since whether he was really as powerful a Judge as he
then seemed to me to be, or whether perhaps his dominating personality
threw a kind of spell over me. I remember that his charge would often efface
the impressions made by the arguments of counsel. He seemed to be
in exuberant health and spirits, and to have before him the prospect of
many years of usefulness and distinction. He died on February 22, 1864,
and was succeeded by Mercer Beasley, who held office for thirty-three
years, and wrote his name high on the scroll of New Jersey worthies. I
wonder how many of the Essex Bar now remember seeing Chief Justice
Whelpley at the Essex Circuit. He held the Union Circuit also, and, I
have heard, used to get his dinner in New York on the ground that there
was nothing fit to eat in Union county. He was probably unfortunate in
his choice of a restaurant, or perhaps his requirements were unusual, for
he is said to have spoken unfavorably of our national bird, the turkey, because
a turkey is &#147;too much for one and not enough for two.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Judge Haines left the Bench at the expiration of his term on November
15, 1866, and was succeeded by David A. Depue, who held office as Judge
and Chief Justice and was a strong pillar of society, until November 16,
1901.</p>

<p class="indent">A Persian proverb says that a Stone fit for the wall is never left in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
the road, and so, as it was according to the evident fitness of things that
Mr. Dodd should become a Judge, that event came to pass when Chancellor
Zabriskie, in 1871, appointed him the first Vice-Chancellor. In 1875
he resigned his office, and in 1881 was reappointed by Chancellor Runyon.
He became also a specially appointed Judge of the Court of Errors and Appeals,
thus strengthening its equity side. In a Court many of whose most
important issues are in equity, and one of whose members is the Chancellor,
who is precluded from sitting in equity cases, it is always well that
some of the Judges should have, or have had, the valuable experience of
sitting alone in equity, and dealing at first hand with the rules of equity
practice and procedure. This has been the case with Justice Bergen and
Mr. Dodd. No other instances occur to me.</p>

<p class="indent">The highwater mark of Vice Chancellor Dodd&#146;s judicial duty was
reached in the memorable case of Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. National
Railway Co., 23 Equity 441, decided at the February term, 1873. This was
before the General Railroad Law, and there was a strong movement,
backed by much public opinion, and attended by some public excitement
and high feeling, to break the monopoly of the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company by uniting interests and connecting existing roads, so as to secure
an independent through line between New York and Philadelphia.
The purpose was meritorious, for the State needed another through line.
The case which Vice-Chancellor Dodd decided was in form an application
to enjoin the National Railway Company from proceeding with the
construction of its road in New Jersey with intent to use it as part of a
through line from New York to Philadelphia. The argument which, with
the reading of proofs, took two weeks, was upon a rule to show cause why
an injunction should not issue pursuant to the prayer of the bill. Attorney-General
Stockton, Mr. Theodore Cuyler and others were counsel for
the complainant, and Mr. Cortlandt Parker and others represented the
defendants. I went to Trenton to hear the opinion. The reading of it
took about an hour. The gist of the opinion, which was for the complainant,
was this,&mdash;not that several links might not form a chain, but that the
defendants&#146; so-called links formed no chain because the legislative acts
which created them indicated no intent that they should connect. The
opinion shows Vice-Chancellor Dodd&#146;s strong judicial qualities; admirable
language and style, clear statement, controversial force, persuasive reasoning
and exposition, all, in their combination, leading up to a high level
of jurisprudence. I know of nothing in the New Jersey books more skillful
or nobly ethical than portions of this opinion. Vice-Chancellor Dodd
would not have esteemed it praise to be told that the case was a test of his
nerve, for, though his feelings were easily wounded, he was far above being
moved by clamor, either before or after a decision. I will not dwell
on Vice-Chancellor Dodd&#146;s other opinions. They are numerous and may
be consulted in the volumes in which they are printed, beginning with 22nd
Equity.</p>

<p class="indent">A strong magnet was drawing Vice-Chancellor Dodd away from the
law to a pursuit attractive to one of his mathematical bent: I mean the
intellectual side of the science and art of life insurance, and it finally captured
him. Perhaps some readers of the New Jersey Law Journal have
been favored, as I have been, by polite letters from one or more insurance
companies, offering options between two or three propositions about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
equally unintelligible, and have, perhaps improvidently, solved the problem
by selecting the one which seemed to promise most immediate cash.
To such persons, if any there be, I respectfully commend the perusal of a
valued and interesting book of about four hundred pages which lies before
me, entitled &#147;Reports to the Board of Directors of the Mutual Benefit
Life Insurance Company, made by Amzi Dodd as Mathematician or
President, from October, 1877, to January 21, 1901.&#148; I can say like Hamlet,
&#147;I am ill at these numbers,&#148; if I may be pardoned for perverting the
meaning of the Prince of Denmark, but I have sufficient comprehension to
see that the same man wrote the opinions and the reports, and that they
are characterized by the same high mental and moral qualities.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Dodd was fond of Governor William Pennington and liked to
talk about him. They became acquainted when they met in a cow case at
Orange. An old woman&#146;s cow was run down and killed by a Morris &amp;
Essex train and young Dodd sued the railroad. It had not then been judicially
determined in New Jersey whether a cow or the locomotive had
the superior right of way. The case was tried before a Justice of the
Peace with a jury. Dodd was very much on his good behavior and treated
the Governor with extreme courtesy. He had the crowd with him and
triumphantly won the verdict. The next day Governor Pennington called
on him, or sent for him, complimented him on his management of the case,
and spoke of his own friendship with Amzi Dodd, an uncle of young Amzi,
who was a capable Newark lawyer, a careless, unsystematic man of whom
I heard Mr. Cortlandt Parker tell that he carried his papers in his hat,
and was said sometimes to lose both hat and papers together.</p>

<p class="indent">One day, Amzi Dodd, the uncle, came into Governor Pennington&#146;s
office and said: &#147;Good morning, Governor. Confound these young fellows!
They get all my books away from me. Now there is &#145;Elmer&#146;s
Forms.&#146; I own a copy of it, and it has my name in it, but it is gone. It is
a very useful book. I need it every day. Governor, have you a copy that
you can let me have?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Governor Pennington, who was a courtly gentleman of the old school
and something of a wag, answered very gravely:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Mr. Dodd, I agree with you about &#145;Elmer&#146;s Forms.&#146; It is an excellent
office book. I consult it every day and should be sorry to be without
it, but you know, Mr. Dodd, that I am always ready to oblige you,
and I will cheerfully let you have it if you will promise in writing to return
it when I need it.&#148; &#147;Certainly,&#148; said Mr. Dodd, and dashed off a
serio-comic agreement to return the book when called for. He folded the
document and handed it to the Governor, and the Governor handed him
his own missing book.</p>

<p class="indent">I told this to my old Yale friend, William Pennington of Paterson, a
nephew of the Governor, who chuckled and said, &#147;I can see him doing
it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Governor Pennington used often to associate young Dodd with him
in the trial of causes. He had been Governor under the old Constitution
and <i>ex-officio</i> Chancellor, but was not scholarly and relied very much on
his knowledge of the world, tact, and strong common sense. Mr. Dodd
once told me that while the Governor knew very little law, he was a most
dangerous antagonist before a jury. If he had the close he was almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
sure to get the jury with him, and if you had the close he would sit in
front of the jury and smile your speech away.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Dodd is my authority for this story: Ex-Governor Daniel Haines,
the Justice of the Supreme Court who held the Essex Circuit, was a man
of strict views, and Mr. Cortlandt Parker, the Prosecutor of the Pleas,
was discharging his important duties with a force and efficiency worthy
of national issues and a wider stage, and so, what with the austerity of
the Judge and the zeal of the Prosecutor, the way of the transgressor
was growing hard, and it was getting to be common talk among the
rounders and hangers-on at the courthouse that if a man was indicted he
might as well plead guilty at once and save the county the expense of a
trial. Some malefactor, with more money or spirit than the others, paid
Governor Pennington a good fee and instructed him to fight. The Governor
had been informed of the current gossip, and thought he would see
what he could make out of it. So he told the jury in his most impressive
manner, that a man is taken to be innocent until he is proved to be
guilty; that this is the palladium of our liberties; and that he feared that
this precious, fundamental right was not sufficiently borne in mind, even
in the courthouse of the county of Essex, and that it was too much assumed
that conviction ought to follow indictment. At this point Judge
Haines, with a flushed face and his eyes shining brightly through his gold-rimmed
spectacles, interrupted the Governor, and said that he had heard
the remarks of the distinguished counsel with much surprise and regret;
that they conveyed an imputation upon the Court itself&mdash;an intimation that
he was derelict in his duty toward an important class of suitors, the defendants
in criminal cases, and that he desired to know and now asked
counsel to state from what persons he heard these strictures upon the
Court. Governor Pennington, with his usual urbanity, bowed and said:
&#147;It is mainly from the criminals themselves.&#148; This answer occasioned
such a sudden revulsion of thought and feeling as to discompose the
Judge and convulse the Bar.</p>

<p class="indent">It is now just seventy years since Mr. Dodd went to Trenton to hear
and see Daniel Webster and Rufus Choate in the case of Charles Goodyear
against Horace H. Day, pending in the Circuit Court of the United
States before Judge Grier of the Supreme Court, and a District Judge.
There is probably now no living member of the Bench or Bar of New
Jersey who attended that trial even as a spectator. As to this case I quote
briefly from Mr. Choate&#146;s &#147;Commemorative Discourse&#148; on Webster, delivered
at Dartmouth College on July 27, 1852:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The professional life of Mr. Webster began in the spring of 1805.
It may not be said to have ended until he died; but I do not know that it
happened to him to appear in Court, for the trial of a cause, after his argument
of the Goodyear patent for improvements in the preparation of India-rubber,
in Trenton, in March, 1852. There I saw him and last heard
him. The thirty-four years which had elapsed since, a member of this
College, at home for health, I first saw and heard him in the Supreme
Court of Massachusetts, in the county of Essex, defending Jackman, accused
of the robbery of Goodrich, had in almost all things changed him.
The raven hair, the vigorous, full frame and firm tread, the eminent but
severe beauty of the countenance, not yet sealed with the middle age of
man, the exuberant demonstration of all sorts of power, which so marked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
him at first&mdash;for these, as once they were, I explored in vain. Yet how
far higher was the interest that attended him now: his sixty-nine years
robed, as it were, with honor and with love, with associations of great
service done to the State, and of great fame gathered and safe; and then
the perfect mastery of the cause in its legal and scientific principles, and
in all its facts; the admirable clearness and order in which his propositions
were advanced successively; the power, the occasional high ethical tone,
the appropriate eloquence, by which they were made probable and persuasive
to the judicial reason&mdash;these announced the leader of the American
bar, with every faculty and every accomplishment, by which he had won
that proud title, wholly unimpaired; the eye not dim nor the natural
force abated.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Webster represented Goodyear, Mr. Choate represented Day.
The injunction which Goodyear applied for was granted. Day surrendered
his license, transferred his factory and machinery to a representative
of Goodyear, and agreed to retire from the business for the sum of $350,000,
and counsel fees amounting to $21,000 additional, which amounts
were paid. Mr. Webster&#146;s retainer was $15,000.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Dodd liked to talk about this case. Mr. Webster and Mr. Choate
each spoke for two days, or parts of two days. Chancellor Green is said
to have called Mr. Choate&#146;s argument the finest that he ever heard in
Court. Lawyers came from all over the State to attend the trial. Mr.
Dodd said that at times Mr. Choate would seem &#147;to go up like a balloon.&#148;
One who has heard or even read Choate knows how at times he would
seem to lift himself and his audience on the rushing wings of his magical
oratory.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the junior counsel for Day had made some impression by
dwelling on the hardships of operatives if the injunction should be granted.
The day was getting late and Judge Grier suggested to Mr. Webster,
who was to speak next, that the Court adjourn until the next day. Mr.
Webster assented, but said: &#147;There is one thing that I wish to say now. If
Mr. Day&#146;s operatives are likely to be distressed, it will be because of his
own default, of his own breach of faith, of his own repudiation of his
own solemn contract, under his own hand and seal,&#148; and, as he said it, his
voice deepened and his eyes flashed, and the courtroom rang as with a peal
of mellow thunder. Mr. Dodd came out of Court with ex-Chancellor Halsted
who said: &#147;Well, Amzi, the old lion has given his first growl.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The case is reported in 10 Federal Cases, page 638, Case No. 5569.</p>

<p class="indent">In a footnote is this extract from Mr. Webster&#146;s argument. It is interesting,
for it shows him at his very best and is not generally known.
His biographer, Mr. G. T. Curtis, speaks of this argument as one of the
most remarkable and interesting of his forensic efforts.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I believe,&#148; said Mr. Webster, &#147;that the man who sits at this table,
Charles Goodyear, is to go down to posterity in the history of the Arts in
this country, in that great class of inventors at the head of which stands
Robert Fulton, in which class stand the names of Whitney and of Morse,
and in which class will stand &#145;<i>non post long intervallo</i>&#146; the humble name
of Charles Goodyear. Notwithstanding all the difficulties he encountered
he went on. If there was reproach he bore it. If poverty, he suffered under
it; but he went on, and these people followed him from step to step,
from 1834 to 1839, or until a later period when his invention was completed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
and then they opened their eyes with astonishment. They then
saw that what they had been treating with ridicule was sublime; that what
they had made the subject of reproach was the exercise of great inventive
genius; that what they had laughed at was the perseverance of a man of
talent with great perceptive faculties, which had brought out a wonder
as much to their astonishment as if another sun had arisen in the hemisphere
above. He says of his cell in the debtors&#146; jail that &#145;it is as good
a lodging as he may expect this side the grave&#146;; he hopes his friends will
come and see him on the subject of India rubber manufacture; and then
he speaks of his family and of his wife. He had but two objects, his family
and his discovery. In all his distress and in all his trials his wife was
willing to participate in his sufferings, and endure everything, and hope
everything; she was willing to be poor; she was willing to go to prison, if
it was necessary, when he went to prison; she was willing to share with
him everything; and that was his solace. May it please your honors, there
is nothing upon the earth that can compare with the faithful attachment of
a wife; no creature who, for the object of her love, is so indomitable, so
persevering, so ready to suffer and to die. Under the most depressing
circumstances woman&#146;s weakness becomes mighty power; her timidity
becomes fearless courage; all her shrinking and sinking passes away, and
her spirit acquires the firmness of marble&mdash;adamantine firmness, when
circumstances drive her to put forth all her energies under the inspiration
of her affections. Mr. Goodyear survived all this, and I am sure he
would go through the same suffering ten times again for the same consolation.
He carried on his experiments perseveringly, and with success,
and obtained a patent in 1844 for his great invention.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">There is a spirited report of the same case in 2 Wallace Jr., where, at
pages 294 and 295, are some turns of thought and expression very characteristic
of Mr. Webster.</p>

<p class="indent">A few months later, on October 24, 1852, Daniel Webster died at
Marshfield.</p>

<p class="indent">Years after the Trenton trial Mr. Dodd was in Boston, and was inclined
to call on Mr. Choate, at his office, but at the very door his diffidence
made him withdraw. He should have gone on. An opportunity was
lost. It was said of Mr. Choate that he treated every man with the courtesy
due to a woman, and every woman as though she were a queen. He
bore interruptions cheerfully, almost gladly. Mr. Choate would have been
found working at a standing desk covered with his hieroglyphic notes,
undecipherable except by himself; he would have cordially owned his visitor&#146;s
fraternal claim to his attention; and he would have kindled to the
depths of his nature at the memory of his last encounter with his mighty
friend.</p>

<h2>IN RE B. &amp; B. MOTOR SALES CORPORATION.</h2>

<p class="center">(U. S. Dist. Court, Dist. of New Jersey, Jan. 18, 1922).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Bankruptcy&mdash;Sale of Auto Truck&mdash;Conditional Agreement and Its Transfer&mdash;Right
to Possession of Property&mdash;Uniform Conditional Sales Act</i></p>

<p class="indent">In the matter of B. &amp; B. Motor Sales Corporation, bankrupt. On
exceptions to Master&#146;s report denying The First People&#146;s Trust petition
for certain property held by the Receiver.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Harry Green for Exceptants, The First People&#146;s Trust.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Barney Larkey for the Receiver.</p>

<p class="indent">RELLSTAB, District Judge: The First People&#146;s Trust excepts to
the Master&#146;s findings that it is not entitled to Apex truck No. 5365, found
in the possession of the B. &amp; B. Motor Sales Corporation (hereinafter
called the bankrupt,) at the time the receiver took charge of the bankrupt&#146;s
estate.</p>

<p class="indent">The facts are: The bankrupt carried on the business of buying and
selling auto trucks. On July 12, 1920, it agreed in writing with Robert
Jones to sell him the truck in question for $1,955, payable in monthly
installments. In this writing (called a &#147;conditional sale agreement&#148;),
signed by both parties, it was declared, inter alia, that the bankrupt had
that day delivered the truck to the buyer; that the title to the truck was not
to pass to the buyer, but was to &#147;remain vested in and be the property of
the seller or assigns until the purchase price has been fully paid;&#148; that
if Jones failed to pay any of the installments when due the bankrupt might
without demand, notice, or process, take possession of the truck, whereupon
Jones&#146; right therein should terminate absolutely, and all payments
made thereon be restrained by the bankrupt as liquidated damages and
rent. At the same time, Jones executed two notes to the bankrupt, one for
the sum of $1,427.15 (in the conditional sale agreement recited to be the
balance to be paid on the truck), payable in twelve monthly installments,
wherein it was declared that &#147;upon default in the payment of any installment
when due, the whole amount remaining unpaid shall immediately
become due;&#148; the other note represented the remainder (or some part of
it) of the purchase price.</p>

<p class="indent">Both the conditional sale agreement and the $1,427.15 note subsequently
were transferred by the bankrupt to the First People&#146;s Trust. The
transfer of the agreement is dated July 12, 1920, and recites that it is
simultaneous with the purchase of the note; in terms it sells, assigns and
transfers the bankrupt&#146;s right, title and interest in the automobile in question
and also in the conditional sale agreement, and asserts that the automobile
was sold and not consigned to the buyer. The transfer of the
note bears no date, is in the form of an endorsement, guarantees payment
of the note, principal and interest, waives demand and protest, and is
signed by the bankrupt by its President and Secretary, and by the same
persons individually.</p>

<p class="indent">Jones had possession of the truck for several months, and, after making
some of the stipulated payments, defaulted in further payments on
both notes. The bankrupt repossessed itself of the truck, and was in
possession thereof at the time the receiver took charge. Neither the conditional
sale agreement nor the assignment was recorded. No rights or
interests of any purchaser or creditor of Jones, the buyer, are involved in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
these proceedings, the controversy being exclusively between the assignee
of the conditional sale agreement and the creditors of the bankrupt
(seller).</p>

<p class="indent">The Master held that the assignment of the conditional sale agreement
&#147;was to act as a mortgage for the payment of the notes;&#148; and that,
as neither the conditional sale agreement nor the assignment had &#147;been
recorded in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey and ...
the B. &amp; B. Motor Sales Corporation had repossessed the truck and had
it in its possession at the time of the appointment of the receiver,&#148; the
receiver, and not the First People&#146;s Trust, was entitled to it.</p>

<p class="indent">First, as to the conditional sale agreement. The New Jersey Uniform
Conditional Sales Act, approved April 15, 1919, effective from July 4,
1919 (N. J. P. L., p. 461), in section 1, defines a seller as &#147;the person
who sells or leases the goods covered by the conditional sale, or any legal
successor in interest of such person.&#148; In section 4 it declares that:
&#147;Every provision in a conditional sale reserving property in the seller
after possession of the goods is delivered to the buyer, shall be valid as
to all persons, except as hereinafter otherwise provided.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The exceptions here referred to are contained in section 5, which
declares that:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Every provision in a conditional sale reserving property in the seller
shall be void as to any purchaser from or creditor of the buyer, who, without
notice of such provision, purchases the goods or acquires by attachment
or levy a lien upon them, before the contract or a copy thereof shall
be filed as hereinafter provided, unless such contract or copy is so filed
within ten days after the making of the conditional sale.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">From this recital it will be seen that as no purchaser from or creditor
of Jones is questioning the validity of such reservation, as between the
bankrupt and Jones, the reservation to the bankrupt of title and property
in the truck, was valid, notwithstanding the failure to record the agreement.</p>

<p class="indent">Second, as to the assignment of the conditional sale agreement: The
New Jersey Chattel Mortgage Act (Revision of 1892; 1 Comp. Stat. N.
J., p. 463) in section 4, declares:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Every mortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage of
goods and chattels hereafter made, which shall not be accompanied by an
immediate delivery, and followed by an actual and continued change of
possession of things mortgaged, shall be absolutely void as against the
creditors of the mortgagor, and as against subsequent purchasers and
mortgagees in good faith, unless the mortgage, having annexed thereto an
affidavit or affirmation made and subscribed by the holder of said mortgage,
his agent, or attorney, stating the consideration of said mortgage
and as nearly as possible the amount due and to grow due thereon, be recorded
as directed in the succeeding section of this Act.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">To constitute a mortgage the right of redemption must exist, and
where such right is established the form of the conveyance is not controlling.
Wilmerding, Heguet &amp; Co. v. Mitchell, 42 N. J. L. (12 Vr.) 476;
Hastings v. Fithian (E. &amp; A.), 71 N. J. L. (42 Vr.) 311. An assignment
of a chose in action, even if it be a security for the payment of a debt, is
not a chattel mortgage within the meaning of the New Jersey Chattel
Mortgage Act. Bleakley v. Nelson, 56 N. J. E. (11 Dick. Ch.) 674. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
Act applies only &#147;when the goods mortgaged are capable of such open and
visible possession that their holding by a mortgagor, who had given a
secret mortgage, might tempt someone to deal with him as the absolute
owner.&#148; Cumberland National Bank v. Baker, 57 N. J. E. (12 Dick. Ch.)
231, 242.</p>

<p class="indent">The assignment now under consideration was not given as a security.
It was an absolute transfer of the seller&#146;s property and interest in the conditional
sale agreement and the automobile mentioned therein, without
right of redemption. By this assignment The People&#146;s Trust became the
&#147;legal successor in interest&#148; referred to in section one of the Uniform Conditional
Sales Act, supra; and the reservation of property contained in the
conditional sale agreement was transferred to it by the assignment. The
assigned agreement recited that the automobile had been delivered to the
buyer, and the assignment expressly recited that it had been sold to Jones
(the buyer); and the assignor at the time of the assignment was not in a
position to retain the automobile, or to deliver it to the assignee. What
the assignor could deliver to The People&#146;s Trust was the conditional sale
agreement, and that was done. Had the transfer been to secure a debt, the
delivery of the conditional sale agreement would savor more of a pledge
than a chattel mortgage, but, as the assignment was absolute and not conditional,
it was neither.</p>

<p class="indent">Such a transaction is not contemplated by the Chattel Mortgage Act,
which covers transactions where the title, but not possession, is transferred;
but by the Uniform Conditional Sales Act, supra, which operates
upon transactions where the possession, but not the title, is transferred.
The right of The People&#146;s Trust to the automobile is fixed by the assigned
conditional sale agreement, and is superior to the rights of the bankrupt
or its creditors&mdash;here represented by the receiver.</p>

<p class="indent">As opposed to this view, and in support of the Master&#146;s finding, the
case of David Straus Co. v. Commercial Delivery Co. (N. J. Ct. Ch.), 113
Atl. 604, affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals, 112 Atl. 417, is cited
by the receiver. That case, made up of facts which existed before the
Uniform Conditional Sales Act went into effect, presents many features
similar to the instant case. However, the differences, and not the similarities,
are controlling. The pertinent facts were: Coincident with the agreement
(called a lease) relating to the delivery and use of the automobile
truck, the lessee (driver) entered into a service contract with the lessor
(Commercial Delivery Company). In that contract the driver agreed to
work the truck under the direction of the lessor for two years, and in no
other way than as directed by it, and to deliver to the lessor the entire
gross monthly earnings. The contract also provided that out of these
moneys the latter was to retain a certain percentage for its services, pay
the wages of the drivers, storage charges, repairs, etc., and credit the balance
to the driver; and that the truck should at all times be stored in a
garage furnished by the lessor. The lessor assigned to the Morris Plan
Company all its right, title and interest in the lease and the property therein
described, and agreed, &#147;in the event of any resale, release, or repossession
of said property,&#148; to pay to the assignee any deficiency between the net
proceeds of such resale and the amount necessary to pay the unpaid installments.
At the time of this assignment the assignee took a note made jointly
by the assignor and the driver for the sum advanced by the assignee as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
consideration for the assignment. Subsequently an equity receiver in insolvency
proceedings was appointed for the lessor, and the receiver found
it in possession of the truck. The Morris Plan Company petitioned that
the truck be delivered to it as the legal owner thereof. The Vice-Chancellor
held that the assignor was a debtor of the assignee; that the assignment
was not an absolute sale of the truck, but collateral security for the payment
of the debt; that while the lease apparently gave the right of possession
to the driver (lessee), the actual possession, by reason of the service
contract, was always in the lessor; that the assignment of the lease was in
legal effect a chattel mortgage; and that not having been recorded it was
void as against the receiver and creditors of the assignor. As already
stated this finding was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals.</p>

<p class="indent">In the cited case, as noted, it was held that the possession, as well as
the title, of the truck was in the lessor at the time of the assignment of the
lease or sale agreement; and that the assignment was not an absolute sale
of the agreement, but a security for the payment of the advances made by
the assignee for which payment the assignor was jointly liable with the
driver. In the instant case, the actual, as well as the right of possession of
the truck, was not in the bankrupt, but in a third person&mdash;the buyer&mdash;and
the assignment was an absolute transfer of the bankrupt&#146;s property in the
conditional sale agreement, without right of redemption. These differences
are essential, and distinguish the cases.</p>

<p class="indent">The fact that the truck was taken from the buyer by the bankrupt
subsequent to the latter&#146;s assignment of the conditional sale agreement,
gave it not property or right in the truck as against its assignee, The First
People&#146;s Trust. Whatever rights such possession gave it as against the
buyer, they were subordinate to the assignee&#146;s right of possession on the
buyer&#146;s default in the terms of the conditional sale agreement then held
by the assignee. Such default having taken place, the assignee is entitled
to the possession of the truck.</p>

<p class="indent">The Master&#146;s findings are disapproved, and an order will be made
giving The First People&#146;s Trust the possession of the truck in question.</p>

<h2>OSBORNE &amp; MARSELLIS CO. v. ESSEX CO.</h2>

<p class="center">(Essex Co. Circuit Court, Feb. 3, 1922).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Compensation for Road Labor Performed Under County Contract&mdash;Ultra Vires
Resolution</i></p>

<p class="indent">Case of The Osborne &amp; Marsellis Company against County of Essex.</p>

<p class="indent">Messrs. Edwin B. and Philip Goodell for Plaintiff.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Arthur T. Vanderbilt for Defendant.</p>

<p class="indent">DUNGAN, J.: This is a suit brought by Osborne &amp; Marsellis Company
against the County of Essex to recover compensation for labor performed
and materials furnished in the improvement of a part of Franklin
avenue, a county road in the county of Essex, prior to the allowance
of a writ of certiorari to review the legality of the contract under which
the work was done, which contract was set aside by the Supreme Court,
and the decision of that Court was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals.
Chamber of Commerce v. County of Essex, 114 Atl. 426.</p>

<p class="indent">The case is submitted upon a statement of the case and stipulation of
facts for judgment, without pleadings; the parties agreeing that the issues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
be submitted to this Court for decision, without trial by jury, and that &#147;No
appeal will be taken from the judgment entered on his findings.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">From the agreed statement of fact it appears that there was no irregularity
on the part of Osborne &amp; Marsellis in the bid, in the awarding
of the contract, or in the execution of the contract, which was approved as
to form by the county counsel, and a bond was furnished which was also
approved, both in accordance with the resolution of the Board awarding
the contract. It also appears that, after the adoption of the resolution
awarding the contract, the plaintiff commenced the work and performed
work and furnished materials, the value of which, at the unit prices fixed
by the contract, amounted to $18,562.80, all of which labor and materials
were performed and furnished prior to the allowance of the writ and
prior to notice that application would be made for the writ, &#147;except such
work as was necessary to leave the unfinished road in condition as required
by law.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The grounds upon which the contract was set aside appear fully in
the case of Chamber of Commerce v. County of Essex, 114 Atl. 426.</p>

<p class="indent">Two defenses to the plaintiff&#146;s claim are urged: First, that the contract
was not signed by the director of the Board of Freeholders; and,
second, that the resolution constituted an ultra vires act of the Board of
Freeholders and that there can be no recovery upon quantum meruit
where the act is ultra vires.</p>

<p class="indent">1. The resolution of the Board of Freeholders relating to the awarding
of the contract, which included other contracts, is as follows: &#147;Resolved
that the contracts ... be and the same are <i>hereby awarded</i>;&#148;
and that &#147;the director and clerk be and they are hereby authorized and
directed to execute contracts with said companies pursuant to this resolution,&#148;
the only conditions being that a proper bond be furnished and that
the contract and bond be approved by the county counsel, and both contract
and bond were so approved. The contract, therefore, was awarded
by the resolution itself, and the formal document, approved by the county
counsel, was actually signed by the clerk and the seal of the county affixed
thereto by him, and the failure of the director to sign was a failure to
perform a purely ministerial act, the performance of which could have
been required by proper legal proceedings. Therefore, I hold that the
plaintiff is not prevented from recovering on account of the failure of the
director to sign the contract.</p>

<p class="indent">2. The subject of the contract is one which was entirely within the
powers of the Board, and hence it cannot be said that the action of the
Board in awarding the contract to the plaintiff was ultra vires in that respect.
After the adoption of the resolution awarding the contract, and
after the approval of the plaintiff&#146;s bond and the form of the contract by
the county counsel, and the affixing thereto of the signature of the clerk
and the seal of the county, the plaintiff commenced the work contemplated
by the contract. Grade stakes were furnished by the County Engineer&#146;s
department, and the work which was performed was under the supervision
and direction of an inspector furnished by that department, and the portion
of the road upon which the work was done was completed and left
ready for use and is now actually in use by the public.</p>

<p class="indent">This situation, it seems to me, brings this case within the decision of
the Supreme Court in Wentink v. Freeholders of Passaic, 37 Vroom, p.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
65, in which it appeared that a contract to do the mason work of a bridge
was let to Wentink, which contract the Court subsequently declared void
because the firm to whom a contract for the same work had been originally
awarded, but which had failed to furnish a bond, had no notice that their
bid had been rejected. Wentink expended $600 in attempting to secure
materials and in the execution of the contract. The Court held, that even
though the county had derived no benefit from such expenditure, Wentink
might recover the amount expended. The Court said: &#147;There was
no lack of power to make the contract with the plaintiff. The fatal defect
was in an irregular exercise of such power. It would be too much to
hold every contractor for a public body to a scrutiny at his peril of the
corporate proceedings. All that he need look to is the power to make
the ostensible contract.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">On the question of damages the Court said: &#147;In the case in hand the
performance of the contract was not prevented by the fault of the defendant,
but by <i>vis major</i>. The making of the contract was, however,
induced by such fault, and on its annulment the defendant should answer,
as on a quantum meruit for the work done thereunder,&#148; and that, &#147;As to
the measure of the quantum meruit for the work done the contract rate
should govern.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">It is admitted that at the contract rate the work which was performed
by the plaintiff would have amounted to $18,562.80. Since this case is
submitted for judgment without pleadings, and since the statement of the
case and the stipulation of facts make no provision for interest, the judgment
of the Court will be in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant
for that sum.</p>

<h2>IN RE ELIZABETH AVENUE ASSESSMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">(Union Co. Common Pleas, Jan., 1922).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Assessment for Repairing Street&mdash;Method Employed&mdash;Method Suggested</i></p>

<p class="indent">In re appeal from assessment for repairing Elizabeth Avenue from
Front street to Seventh street, Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Alfred S. Brown, Appellant, in person.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Joseph T. Hague, for City of Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">PIERCE, J.: This is an appeal from an assessment for repaving
with granite blocks that portion of Elizabeth avenue, Elizabeth, extending
from a point about 150 feet east of Front street to Seventh street. The
error complained of is inequality as compared with other assessments.</p>

<p class="indent">Appellant is the owner of a triangular lot of land lying between
Elizabeth and First avenues, at their intersection at Liberty Square; the
lot is bounded northerly 350 feet on Elizabeth avenue, easterly 31 feet on
Liberty Square, southerly about 350 feet on First avenue, and westerly
133 feet on abutting property; the lot is vacant except for an old house at
the southwest corner fronting on First avenue.</p>

<p class="indent">The general method of assessment adopted by the Commissioners
was as follows: From the whole cost of the improvement, $220,330.56,
was deducted $23,127.29, paid by the Public Service Company for repaving
its trolley tracks, leaving $197,203.27, of which one-half was assumed
by the City and the other half assessed upon abutting property, being at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
the rate of $8.82 per linear front foot. The Commissioners adopted this
linear front-foot rate as the bases of the assessment, and imposed it upon
all lots one hundred feet deep; short lots were given concessions assumed
by the City, viz., 12-1/2 per cent. off where the lot was 50 feet deep, 18-3/4
per cent. off where the lot was 25 feet deep, and in that proportion. The
Commissioners determined that as to all the lots the assessment was less
than the value of the lot, and less than the benefit conferred, but gave no
consideration as to the relative value of the lots as between themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">In assessing appellant&#146;s triangular lot the following method was
adopted: The lot was divided lengthwise by an imaginary line into two
equal parts, one fronting on First avenue and the other on Elizabeth avenue.
The part on First avenue was not assessed. The part on Elizabeth
avenue was assessed at the regular rate of $8.82 for its 350 feet frontage,
a total $3,087.00, less three concessions: a concession of 12-1/2 per cent.
($110.25) was allowed on the westerly 100 feet averaging fifty odd feet
deep; a concession of 20 per cent. ($441.00) was allowed on the remaining
250 feet averaging thirty odd feet deep; and a concession of 25 per
cent. ($68.35) was allowed for the 31 feet fronting on Liberty Square.
Total concessions, $619.61, leaving $2,467.40 as the assessment levied. In
addition to the concessions the Commissioners made no assessment against
the lot for its frontage on Liberty Square.</p>

<p class="indent">The result reached by the Commissioners was to assess a lot 350 feet
in front on Elizabeth avenue, 15-1/2 feet deep at one end and 66-1/2 at the
other, nearly four-fifths as much as though the entire frontage had been
full lots 100 feet deep. This is unreasonable and I think more than appellant&#146;s
entire lot should be assessed.</p>

<p class="indent">I think the Commissioners erred in two respects in their method of
assessment:</p>

<p class="indent">1. It was improper to divide appellant&#146;s lot lengthwise for the purpose
of assessment. The lot was already too shallow for the greater
part of its frontage for ordinary building purposes, and to divide it further
was to leave two narrow strips, one fronting on Elizabeth avenue and
the other on First avenue, neither of any sale value, or practical value for
any purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">It was held by the Court of Errors and Appeals in Aldridge v. Essex
Road Board (51 N. J. L. 166) that assessors may not divide a lot for
the purpose of assessment so that, should a sale result to collect the tax,
the property would not bring as much as if sold as part of the original
parcel. The rule was followed in Coward v. North Plainfield (63 N. J. L.
61), where, as in the case at bar, an imaginary line was drawn midway between
two avenues.</p>

<p class="indent">2. I think the Commissioners erred also in disregarding the relative
benefit received by lots along the line of the improvement resulting from
location and value of the property. The assessment was strictly a front-foot
assessment with concessions for short lots, but disregarding the element
of location and relative value.</p>

<p class="indent">The 4th Ward assessment roll received in evidence shows substantial
variations in the value of properties on Elizabeth avenue, and inspection
of the line of improvement about a mile in length shows greater traffic
and better building and values toward Seventh street than opposite and
below appellant&#146;s lot. The intersection of Elizabeth avenue and High
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
street, a few feet West of Seventh street, is a business center for that
part of the City, and values and traffic are materially greater in that vicinity
than below Third street. It is manifest that business houses dependent
upon traffic for their business are more benefited by a paving improvement
than vacant lots at a distance where there is less traffic.</p>

<p class="indent">It is well settled in New York that the relative value of lots and the
buildings upon them must be considered in determining the benefits accruing
from a paving improvement (Donavan v. Oswego, 39 Misc. 291,
and cases therein cited); and in State v. Rahway (39 N. J. L. 646; affirmed
by the Court of Errors and Appeals in 11 Vr. 615) a greater assessment
upon lots nearer a business center was approved in a grading, curbing and
guttering improvement.</p>

<p class="indent">The statute provides that &#147;all assessments ... levied for any
local improvement shall in each case be as near as may be in proportion
to the peculiar benefit, advantage or increase in value which the respective
lots and parcels of land and real estate shall be deemed to receive by reason
of the improvement.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Under the circumstances existing in the case at bar, there being, as I
find, a difference in benefit along the line of the improvement resulting
from location and value, these elements should have been considered by
the Commission and such weight given them as in the judgment of the
Commissioners they should receive.</p>

<p class="indent">In reassessing appellant&#146;s lot I suggest a different ratio of concessions
for short lots. The concessions adopted by the Commissioners are one-half
the concessions allowed by the Newark, or Hoffman rule, in valuing
short lots in regular assessments. As evidenced by the result reached in
the assessment appealed from, the concessions are inadequate, and I see
no reason why the full concessions established by the Newark rule should
not be adopted.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not easy to formulate a rule that will do justice in all cases in
assessing irregular shaped lots, but I think a fair result would be reached
in the case at bar by deducting from the frontage assessment of $3,087.00
a concession of 25% ($771.00) for the frontage and probable future paving
assessment on First avenue; a further concession at the rates given
by the Newark Rule for that portion of the lot under 100 feet in depth
(20%&mdash;$441.00), less the added value under the same rule for that portion
over 100 feet in length (7%&mdash;$61.74) net $379.26; total net $1,936.74;
less such further concession for less than average benefit received by appellant&#146;s
lot as in the judgment of the Commissioners should be allowed
by reason of inferior location, value and improvements.</p>

<p class="indent">As appellant&#146;s lot is not assessed for paving Liberty Square, no concession
should be made for frontage on Liberty Square.</p>

<p class="indent">For the reasons given, the assessment appealed from should be set
aside as to appellant&#146;s lot.</p>

<h2>STATE v. GRUICH.</h2>

<p class="center">(Essex Quarter Sessions, Dec. 27, 1921).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Criminal Abortion&mdash;New Trial&mdash;Postponing Sentence Days</i></p>

<p class="indent">Case of The State against Anne Gruich. On application for new
trial.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Frank Bradner for Petitioner.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. John A. Bernhard, Assistant Prosecutor of the Pleas, for State
of New Jersey.</p>

<p class="indent">STICKEL, Jr., J.: Anna Gruich was tried before this Court, Judge
Harry V. Osborne presiding, and, on February 21, 1919, convicted of abortion.
The minutes of the Court at the foot of the entry of the verdict of
the jury contain the words, &#147;Sentence postponed.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">On the 23rd day of May, 1919, the said defendant was convicted by
a jury on a second charge of abortion and, on June 5, 1919, sentence of
both convictions was imposed by Judge Osborne, the sentences running
concurrently.</p>

<p class="indent">The conviction on the second charge of abortion having been reversed
by the Court of Errors and Appeals at a recent term of that Court and a
new trial ordered, application is now made to this Court to grant a new
trial on the charge of abortion of which the defendant was convicted on
February 21st, 1919.</p>

<p class="indent">[Here two broad grounds are urged as warranting such action, the first
ground involving a question of fact; that part of the opinion is not published.
The second ground is that the Court, having postponed sentence
thereafter to in a new term of the Court and without having noted in the
minutes continuances of the day of sentence, imposed sentence upon the defendant,
the contention being the Court then had no jurisdiction to impose
any sentence. The opinion continues.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor</span>].</p>

<p class="indent">And I am equally clear that there is no merit in her contention that
the Court had no jurisdiction to sentence in the April Term upon a conviction
had in the December Term.</p>

<p class="indent">The theory of the defendant seems to be that, because the minutes
do not show that the time for sentence was fixed and then postponed from
time to time until the sentence was actually imposed, therefore, no sentence
day was, in fact, fixed, no continuance had, and, when the December Term
expired, the power of the Court to fix a sentence day or impose a sentence
ended.</p>

<p class="indent">The sentence file of this Court will show that the assumption of counsel
is unwarranted, and that a day for sentence was fixed and regular adjournments
of that sentence had from time to time until the day upon
which sentence was imposed. But, even though we assume that no sentence
day was fixed and no continuance in fact taken, the position of counsel
in my judgment is unsound.</p>

<p class="indent">This case is controlled by the principles laid down in the opinion in
Gehrmann v. Osborn, 79 N. J. Eq. 430; 82 Atl. Rep. 424, and by the decision
in that case, and even though, as counsel for the defendant suggests,
I may not be bound by the decision in that case, the reasoning, the logic
and learning thereof is such that I am wholly content to be governed thereby
in determining this case, and convinced that the decision in that case
represents the law of this State.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
There, as in this case, sentence was postponed, and, although more
than two years elapsed before the defendant was actually sentenced, and,
although the original postponement was the practical equivalent of an indefinite
postponement of sentence, the Court upheld a sentence to State
Prison. Here the sentence was imposed but a few months after conviction,
and the postponement was not the equivalent of an indefinite postponement.
And, like in the present case, there were no continuances of
the sentence recorded in the minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The conclusion which I have, therefore, reached,&#148; says Vice-Chancellor
Garrison, &#147;in the Gehrmann case, is that in the State of New Jersey,
if a defendant has pleaded nolle contendere, or guilty, or has been convicted
upon trial, the Court has the power, if the defendant does not object
thereto, and therefore is assumed to assent thereto, to refrain from
pronouncing a judgment or sentence, and may, at a subsequent time, hale
the defendant before it, and impose the punishment in the same manner
that it would have been justified in pronouncing upon the very day when
the case was ripe for sentence.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">It will be observed from the opinion that the duty rests upon the defendant
to object to an indefinite postponement of sentence; that his failure
so to do creates a presumption that he assented thereto, and that his
assent or acquiescence to such postponement disenables him to complain
when thereafter the Court imposes sentence, whether within or without
the term in which the conviction is had or plea taken.</p>

<p class="indent">Here not only is there no proof of an objection, but on page 23 of the
testimony it appears that the defendant at least acquiesced in the postponement
from time to time of the sentence.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, just as the research of the learned Vice-Chancellor convinced
him that an indefinite suspension of sentence has been the custom
in our State beyond the memory of those then connected with the
administration or practice of criminal law in this State, so, from my own
experience as a practitioner in and Judge of this Court do I know that for
years it has been the practice to sentence on a given Monday after conviction;
to sentence periodically all persons convicted or who have pleaded;
to enter in the minutes &#147;Sentence postponed&#148; in bail cases and prisoners
&#147;Remanded for sentence&#148; in jail cases and to advise defendant for counsel,
or both, in open Court of the regular sentence day; for the clerk to
make up a sentence list for said day; for the Court to use such list in sentencing;
for the Court to postpone to another day sentences set down
upon such sentence day when it so determined, the clerk noting the postponement
and placing the case on the new sentence list of the Judge, and
for the clerk to take the various sentence lists and file them as a part of
the records of this Court. This practice I find was followed in this case
and probably accounts for the repeated attendance of the defendant at the
courthouse for sentence. The defendant was convicted on February 21st
and the first sentence day of Judge Osborne thereafter was February
24th, 1919. The defendant&#146;s name appears upon this list for sentence and
a notation is made that the sentence was postponed to March 10th; the
sentence list of March 10th shows a postponement to March 24th; that of
March 24th a postponement to April 14th; that of April 14th a postponement
to May 5th; that of May 5th a postponement to May 26th; that of
May 26th to June 5th, and on June 5th sentence was imposed. If there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
any question about this and the case is to be appealed, I would suggest
that the Prosecutor submit as part of the record on this rule evidence of
the practice of this Court in sentencing, together with the sentence lists of
Judge Osborne covering the period in question.</p>

<p class="indent">The rule obtained in this case is discharged and the application of
the defendant for a new trial denied.</p>

<h2>IN RE WILL OF MARION.</h2>

<p class="center">(Essex Co. Orphans&#146; Court, Jan. 12, 1922).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Probate of Will&mdash;Signing Will &#147;for Sake of Peace&#148;&mdash;Burden of Undue Influence&mdash;Facts
Considered</i></p>

<p class="indent">In the matter of the probate of a certain paper writing purporting to
be the last will and testament of Elizabeth Marion, deceased. On caveat.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Edwin B. Goodell and Mr. Philip Goodell for Proponent.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Paul M. Fischer for Caveator.</p>

<p class="indent">STICKEL, Jr., J: I was satisfied at the conclusion of the hearings in
this matter that the paper writing purporting to be the will of the decedent
had been properly executed, and I was also satisfied that she was capable
of making a will; in other words, that she had testamentary capacity; but
I had some doubt whether the decedent had not consented to the making of
the document in question and signed the same for the sake of peace. Being
thus in doubt I asked counsel to submit briefs on that point alone, and
counsel for the proponent have submitted a brief. Counsel for the caveator
has not submitted a brief, and, as I understand it, does not intend to
submit one.</p>

<p class="indent">The decedent was a woman between fifty and sixty years old. She
had several children, two or three sons and two daughters, as I recall it,
and one of the daughters, Mrs. Appleton, resided, together with her
three children, with the decedent, and had done so for sometime prior to
the execution of the document in question. The decedent and her husband
had lived apart for some years, and the whereabouts of the husband of
Mrs. Appleton were unknown, so that both the decedent and the daughter
daily went out to work.</p>

<p class="indent">The decedent had never made a will. She was not on unfriendly relations
with her children, although there is some suggestion that she disagreed
with all of them at different times. So far as the testimony shows,
she had not indicated definitely to anyone at any time prior to the making
of the document in question what she intended to do with her estate.</p>

<p class="indent">She executed the papers purporting to be her will between five and
six o&#146;clock, P. M., on the 21st day of December, 1920. She died about
one A. M., the succeeding day. She received the last rites at eleven o&#146;clock
in the morning of the day she made the will. At three o&#146;clock in the afternoon,
two or three hours before she made her will, she inquired of her
daughter where certain insurance papers were, and, being told that they
were in possession of the daughter and that the insurance had been paid,
she seemed relieved and said she did not want any trouble over her affairs.
The daughter then asked her whether she had a will and received a
reply in the negative. The daughter, Mrs. Appleton, followed this with an
inquiry whether the decedent wanted to have things fixed up, and the decedent
did not answer her. The daughter, nevertheless, thinking, as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
said, that the employer and friend of her mother, Mrs. Hill, had a will,
called up Mrs. Hill and, apparently, either told Mrs. Hill that the decedent
wanted a lawyer to make a will, or that she had no will and was dying,
for, in any event, Mrs. Hill, shortly after the telephone call, came to the
decedent&#146;s house with Mr. Edwin B. Goodell, a lawyer of Montclair, to
prepare a will for the decedent. The decedent was not asked whether
she wanted to make a will prior to this time, and did not in anyway, so
far as the testimony shows, request the attendance of Mr. Goodell or anyone
else to make a will. When Mr. Goodell acquainted the decedent with
the reason for his attendance, she said she did not want to make a will &#147;tonight,&#148;
or words to that effect; indicating, as Mr. Goodell put it, that she
would prefer not to make a will that night.</p>

<p class="indent">At that time there were in the room with the decedent, who was in
bed, very sick, a Mrs. Fischer, Mrs. Wickham, who was holding her up or
propping her up in bed, Mrs. Appleton, the daughter, Mrs. Hill and Mr.
Goodell. In an adjoining room was a son of the decedent with his child
or children.</p>

<p class="indent">Someone of the persons in the room&mdash;the testimony does not agree
as to who it was, and it may be that it was more than one&mdash;urged and encouraged
the decedent to make a will after her remark that she did not
want to make one that night. Mr. Goodell says he did not, although he felt
that the decedent wanted to make a will, and that if she did not make it
that night she would never make it, because he thought she would die before
morning. In any event, a short time after she said that she did not
want to make a will that night, Mr. Goodell inquired of her what she
wanted to do with her property, and someone in the room, he thinks it
was Mrs. Wickham&mdash;but Mrs. Wickham says it was not, although all
seem to agree that it was not Mrs. Appleton&mdash;suggested that she wanted
to leave her house, the one in which she was then living with her daughter
and grandchildren, to the three grandchildren. The decedent assented
to this. But Mr. Goodell took the precaution to ask her directly whether
she wanted her house to go that way and reminded her it would tie up the
sale of the property, because the children were minors. The decedent, in
replying to this, said that was what she wanted to do; she wanted it so
that it could not be &#147;spent.&#148; Mrs. Hill and Mr. Goodell agree as to this
testimony, and Mrs. Wickham, the only other person in the room, who was
interrogated on this point, said that she had no recollection one way or the
other. Then Mr. Goodell inquired of the decedent what she wanted to do
with the residue of her estate, and again someone volunteered that she
wanted it to go equally among her children. Whereupon Mr. Goodell, having
interrogated the decedent, she replied that she wanted the residue to
go in that way.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Goodell&#146;s recollection is that the decedent nominated the executor,
herself, although he said it is possible that someone else in the room
suggested it and that the decedent assented thereto.</p>

<p class="indent">Thereupon, the will having been read, paragraph by paragraph, the
decedent and the witnesses duly executed it.</p>

<p class="indent">The burden of proving undue influence, of course, rests upon the person
or persons charging undue influence, and, as was said in the case of
Schuchhart v. Schuchhart, in the fourth syllabi, 62 Eq. 710, 49 Atl. 485:
&#147;When undue influence is claimed to be established by inference from certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
facts proved, and, upon all the facts proved, an equally justifiable inference
may be drawn that the will executed was what testator would
have made under the circumstances, the burden on contestants is not supported.&#148;
See also In re Richter&#146;s Will, 89 N. J. Eq. 162.</p>

<p class="indent">The inference which the contestants would have the Court draw from
the facts is that the decedent intended to die intestate, so that her property
would go to her children equally, and that her objection to making a will
that night indicated her desire to die intestate, for she knew that her end
was near and believed that if the making of the will were put off until the
next day she would be dead and dead intestate.</p>

<p class="indent">This is an inference which may be drawn from the facts, but an equally
justifiable inference is that the decedent had the all-too-common disinclination
to draw a will; that she sought to shirk the responsibility of deciding
what disposition to make of her property, to avoid making and executing
a will; that when brought face to face with her responsibility she
yielded to the advice and suggestions of her friends, and, although originally
preferring not to make the will, determined to discharge her responsibility
and make the will. In no other way can the statement of the
decedent that she wanted to tie up the house, so the children could not
spend it, be reconciled. That remark indicated that the decedent had
aroused herself to the task of making her will, had overcome her disinclination,
determined to perform the duty of making a will and had considered
the question of the disposition of her property.</p>

<p class="indent">It is true that others made the suggestion as to what the decedent
wanted to do with the property, and I am inclined to think that everyone in
the room knew from talking with the decedent that she wanted to leave
her property as she actually did leave it, although there is no direct testimony
on this point, but the remark about preventing the children from
spending the property was the product of the decedent&#146;s own mind; she
initiated the remark, and thereby revealed her state of mind, both as to
the matter of making a will at all and as to how she wanted her property
to go. And it is not strange that she wanted the property to go in this
way, for she knew it was her grandchildren&#146;s home (and we all know the
wonderful love that grandparents have for grandchildren); she knew that
they could not depend upon a father for support and upbringing and that
their mother was the breadearner. Her own children were grown up,
married, most of them, and so far as the record shows not to need of assistance.
That the devise of the house to the grandchildren is a natural,
normal one, is emphasized by her disposition of the residue of her estate,
for, having taken care of her grandchildren, assured them of a home during
their minority at least, she proceeded to give to her children everything
else that she had; and I am inclined to think she believed that the residue
of the estate would be much larger than it actually is; that the return she
would get from the estate of Timothy Arnold would be larger than it actually
was.</p>

<p class="indent">It is undoubtedly true that, except for the presence of the lawyer,
which was brought about by Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Appleton, and except for
the advice and encouragement to make a will and at once by those in the
room to the decedent, she would have died without a will. But, instead
of the presence of the lawyer and the said advice and encouragement
dominating the deceased and destroying her free agency, it seems only
to have served to arouse in her the necessity for making a will, if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
would protect her grandchildren, to re-awaken and revive her apparently
dormant and pre-existing desire to provide a home for her grandchildren,
to do this and to give her the opportunity to carry out such desire or intention,
which opportunity she seized and made the best of, for how else can
her response to Mr. Goodell, that she wanted to tie up the house so that
it could not be &#147;spent,&#148; &#147;That is what I want to do,&#148; be accounted for?
Certainly acts which produce such a result cannot be said to be acts of undue
influence. Stewart v. Jordon, 50 N. J. Eq. 733-741. And it is well
settled that it is not the exercise of undue influence to advise, encourage,
or urge the making of a will. In re Barber&#146;s Will, 49 Atl. 826; In the matter
of Seagrist, 1 N. Y. App. Div. 615; 37 N. Y. Supp. 496; Aff. 153 N.
Y. 682; 43 N. E. 1107.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Goodell, who drew the will, is a reputable and careful lawyer,
and I feel sure that he would not have prepared this will or permitted the
decedent to execute it except he felt it represented her real wishes. Nor
do I think he would have permitted her to have executed this document if
he for one moment conceived that she was making it for the sake of peace
or to be rid of her visitors. That fact must also be considered in determining
the question in hand.</p>

<p class="indent">It seems to me, therefore, that the more probable inference to be
drawn from the facts in this case is one which requires the upholding of
the document as the will of the decedent and that the contestants have
not sustained the burden of proving undue influence.</p>

<p class="indent">The paper writing purporting to be the will of Elizabeth Marion is
consequently admitted to probate.</p>

<h2>WOMEN JURORS.</h2>

<p class="indent">Does the right of suffrage entitle women to serve as jurors? This
question has been answered in the affirmative in Michigan, where it was
held, in People v. Barltz, 180 N. W. 423, 12 A.L.R. 520, that a constitutional
declaration that every inhabitant of the State, being a citizen, shall
be an elector and entitled to vote, makes women electors within the meaning
of a statute requiring jurors to be drawn from the electors, and they
are therefore entitled to perform jury duty.</p>

<p class="indent">This decision seems to stand alone. A contrary conclusion was
reached in Re Grilli, 110 Misc. 45, 179 N. Y. Supp. 795, affirmed on
opinion below in 192 App. Div. 885, 181 N. Y. Supp. 938, which involved
the right of an enfranchised woman to compel the board of assessors
and the commissioner of jurors to complete the county jury lists
by including therein the qualified women voters of the county. The Court
said: &#147;The only claim made by the petitioner in connection with her
application is that jury service is incidental to and a part of suffrage, and
since, by the recent amendment of the State Constitution, women are
qualified to vote, they must be made jurors. The fallacy of this contention
is found in an examination of the history of the jury system since
the adoption of the first Constitution in the State of New York. While
citizenship has always been a qualification of jury service, every voter has
not been included within the jury lists. The various laws with reference
to jurors show that men who were entitled to vote have been excluded
from jury service.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
In Illinois, the fact that women are legal voters for the election of
statutory officers, and certain other purposes, is held not to make them
eligible for jury service in criminal cases, in People v. Krause, 196 Ill.
App. 140, and People v. Goehringer, 196 Ill. App. 475.</p>

<p class="indent">In Virginia, according to 6 Va. L. Reg. N. S. 780, Judge Gardner, in
instructing jury commissioners, distinguished between the right to vote
and the duty to render jury service, by stating that the former is a constitutional
right conferred, while the latter is a legislative duty imposed.
He concluded that women cannot lawfully serve as jurors under the
Virginia statute, which limits that duty to &#147;male citizens over twenty-one
years of age,&#148; until the legislature so modifies the statute as to make it
applicable to &#147;all male and female citizens twenty-one years old.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The Court, in the Wyoming case of McKinney v. State, 3 Wyo. 719,
30 Pac. 293, 16 L.R.A. 710, seems to have been of the opinion that a
constitutional provision that &#147;the rights of citizens of the state of Wyoming
to vote and to hold office shall not be abridged or denied on account of
sex,&#148; and that &#147;both male and female citizens of this State shall equally
enjoy all civil, political, and religious rights and privileges,&#148; did not require
that women voters be allowed to serve as jurors.</p>

<p class="indent">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in Re Opinion of
Justices, 130 N. E. 685, answered questions submitted by the House of
Representatives by holding that, under the Constitution of the United
States and the Constitution and laws of Massachusetts, women are not
liable to jury duty. The State statute subjects to jury service persons
&#147;qualified to vote for representatives to the General Court.&#148; These words,
while broad enough to include women, are held not to do so, when interpreted
in connection with the history of the times and the entire system
of which the statute forms a part. It was determined, however, that the
General Court had constitutional power to enact legislation making women
liable to jury duty.&mdash;<i>Case and Comment</i></p>

<h2>MISCELLANY</h2>

<h3>NEW CHANCERY RULE.</h3>

<p class="indent">The Chancery Rules have been
supplemented by the addition of a
new rule numbered 165a, promulgated
January 6, 1922, as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">165a. All pleadings, proofs and
other papers presented to, and all
orders and decrees signed by the
Chancellor or a Vice-Chancellor or
Advisory Master at the State House
in Trenton, shall be forthwith filed
with the clerk; and all such which
shall be so presented and signed at
chambers or elsewhere shall be
marked filed by the Chancellor or
Vice-Chancellor or Advisory Master
(which need only be over the
initials of his name and office, and
may be done by his official stenographer
or sergeant-at-arms at his
direction), and all such papers shall
be retained by the Chancellor or
Vice-Chancellor or Advisory Master
and delivered or forwarded by him,
or at his direction, to the clerk with
all convenient speed.</p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.</h3>

<p class="indent">Attention has been called to the
Bar of Bergen county by Mr. Justice
Parker to a laxity of practice
in relation to supplementary proceedings
in cases of judgment and
execution, and, as the matter should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
interest the Bar of the State generally
we give, herewith, what has
been spread before the Bergen attorneys:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;1. Originally an attorney or
agent could not make the affidavit.
Westfall v. Dunning, 50 N. J. L.
459. This was changed by statute.
P. L. 1890, p. 185. But it should
appear as one of the direct statements
in the affidavit that the attorney
is the attorney, i. e., &#147;J. S.,
being duly sworn, says that he is the
attorney herein for A. B. the plaintiff,&#148;
and not merely, &#147;J. S., attorney
for the plaintiff, being duly
sworn,&#148; which is a mere appositive
and not a definite statement.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;2. Such affidavits frequently
say: &#147;that he has read the foregoing
petition, and that the statements
thereof so far as they relate to his
own acts are true, and so far as they
relate to the acts of others he believes
them to be true.&#148; This, it
would seem, is not a compliance
with Section 24 of the Executions
Act. Such an affidavit in Chancery
was considered in Barr v. Voorhees,
55 Eq. 561, and held sufficient for
an order for discovery, but not for
an injunctive order. But it is to
be noted that this was under Section
90 of the Chancery Act of 1875
(Rev. 121; G. S. 1895, p. 389)
which reads &#147;that he believes the
contents thereof are true,&#148; whereas,
Section 24 of the Executions Act
requires the creditor or his agent to
verify the petition, in which he shall
state the amount due on the execution,
the return by the officer, <i>and
his belief</i> that the creditor has assets,
etc. The belief is, therefore,
restricted to the debtor&#146;s assets and
does not apply to the recovery of
the judgment or the issue or return
of execution. As to these facts,
the late Chief Justice Depue said he
doubted the sufficiency (at law) of
such an allegation. 10 N. J. L. J.
223-4; Frankel v. Miner, 10 N. J.
L. J. 341.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;There is no difficulty about an
attorney deposing from personal
knowledge that a judgment was entered,
and execution issued and returned,
as these things are matters
of record; and as Chief Justice
Beasley said in Westfall v. Dunning,
50 N. J. L. 461 already cited:
&#147;It is obvious that such a statement
could be safely made by anyone
who was possessed of the loosest
information,&#148; etc. He was there
speaking of verifying the belief of
the <i>creditor</i>; under the present act
the belief of the attorney may do
as well, but the criticism seems applicable
to the other allegations also.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The printed forms in Jeffery
and on some of the law blanks are
open to criticism in the above respects,
and debtors should not be
hauled before Commissioners for examination
unless the statute is complied
with.&#148;</p>

<h3>ACCIDENT TO MRS. EMERY.</h3>

<p class="indent">Mrs. John R. Emery, widow of
the late Vice-Chancellor Emery,
while traveling with friends in Algiers,
met with an automobile accident
about Feb. 12th. The automobile
turned over on the edge of a
mine shaft, and it is stated she sustained
a fracture of both arms. She
went abroad Oct. 8th.</p>

<h3>DEATH OF NEWARK&#146;S MAYOR.</h3>

<p class="indent">Mayor Alexander Archibald, of
Newark, died on Feb. 11th, after
an operation for a pressure on the
brain nerves. He is said to have
been the first Mayor of Newark to
die while in office. He was born in
Edinburgh, Scotland, December 13,
1869; was three years of age when
his parents came to America. He
was a silverware manufacturer in
Newark. He was elected to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
Council of Newark in 1910; became
City Clerk in 1914, and in 1917 was
elected City Commissioner and became
Mayor. He was a Democrat
and was talked of as a candidate for
Governor. His funeral was large
and observed generally throughout
the city.</p>

<h3>HUMOR OF THE LAW.</h3>

<p class="indent">A Memphis lawyer entered his
condemned client&#146;s cell: &#147;Well,&#148; he
said, &#147;good news at last!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;A reprieve?&#148; exclaimed the prisoner
eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, but your uncle has died
leaving you $5,000 and you can go
to your fate with the satisfying feeling
that the noble efforts of your
lawyer in your behalf will not go
unrewarded.&#148;</p>

<h3>BOOK RECEIVED.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Nature of the Judicial Process</span>
By Benjamin N. Cardozo, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1821.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">This book is especially welcome
just now, after reading Judge Cardozo&#146;s
article in the December number
of the &#147;Harvard Law Review,&#148;
entitled &#147;A Ministry of Justice,&#148;
which shows that his study of the
nature of the judicial process has
led him to seek for practical means
to correct the errors that have crept
into the law in the application of
legal principles. This article in the
&#147;Harvard Law Review&#148; is in itself
the result of his study during
his long experience on the Bench
of the problem he deals with in
these lectures on the nature of the
judicial process. The book consists
of four lectures delivered in the
William L. Storrs&#146; lecture series in
the Law School of Yale University,
1921. The titles of the lectures suggest
the scope of his inquiry. They
include: The Method of Philosophy;
The Methods of History, Tradition
and Sociology; the Judge as
a Legislator; Adherence to Precedent;
The Subconscious Element in
the Judicial Process.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Any Judge,&#148; he says, &#147;one might
suppose, would find it easy to describe
the process which he had followed
a thousand times and more.
Nothing could be farther from the
truth.&#148; In telling of the study of
precedents in arriving at the rule of
law to be applied to the decision of
cases, he takes up, first, in the introduction,
the method of philosophy
and inquiries, in what proportions
different sources of information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
shall be allowed to contribute to the
result. If a precedent is applicable,
when shall he refuse to follow
it, and if no precedent is applicable,
how does he reach the rule that will
make a precedent for the future?
&#147;If,&#148; he says, &#147;I am seeking logical
consistency, the symmetry of the legal
structure, how far shall I seek
it? At what point shall the quest
be halted by some discrepant custom,
by some consideration of the
social welfare; by my own or the
common standards of justice or
morals?&#148; And again, he says: &#147;The
first thing he does is to compare the
case before him with the precedents,
whether stored in his mind or hidden
in the books. I do not mean
that the precedents are ultimate
sources of the law, supplying the
sole equipment for the legal armory,
the sole tools, to borrow Maitland&#146;s
phrase, &#145;in the legal smithy.&#146;
Back of precedents are the basic
juridical conceptions which are the
postulates of judicial reasoning, and
farther back are the habits of life,
the institutions of society, in which
those conceptions had their origin,
and which, by a process of interaction,
they have modified in turn.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">In the lecture on the methods of
History, Tradition and Sociology,
he shows how the method of Philosophy
comes in competition with other
tendencies which find their outlets
in other methods. The tendency
of a principle to expand itself
to the limit of its logic may be
counteracted by the tendency to
confine itself within the limits
of its history. &#147;Very often,&#148;
he says, quoting Justice Holmes,
&#147;the effect of history is to make the
path of logic clear. History, in illuminating
the past, illuminates the
present, illuminates the future.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The law of real property supplies
the readiest example of a field
where there can be no progress
without history, and where &#147;a page
of history,&#148; to quote Holmes again,
&#147;is worth a volume of logic.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He refers to leading examples of
cases in which history has moulded
the rules established by precedents
and customs, and how the Law Merchant
has not been moulded into a
code, but has been expanded and
enlarged to meet the wants of trade,
and how the course of dealing to be
followed is defined by the customs,
or, more properly speaking, the usages
of a particular trade, or market,
or profession, and the natural
and spontaneous evolutions of habit
fix the limitation of right and
wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">The law of real estate is taken
merely as an example. Maitland,
Holmes, Pollock and Pound, and
many others, have pointed out the
historical origins and development
in the forms of action, the law of
pleading, the law of contract, and
the law of torts. The historic influences
are strong in some departments
of the law, and in others larger
and fundamental conceptions
tend to control the judicial mind,
and there is a tendency to harmony
of the law of different countries.</p>

<p class="indent">From History and Philosophy
and custom he passes to the power
of Social Justice, which he says is
the force that in our day is becoming
the greatest of the directive
forces of the law. It is by the way
of history and tradition that he
comes to the method of Sociology.
It is by the common law method of
applying old principles to new conditions
that Courts have been able
to preserve the continuity of the law
in changing conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the leading cases cited is
the Bakeries case, Lochner v. New
York, 198 U. S. 45, wherein Judge
Cardozo suggested that in this decision
the dissenting opinion of Justice
Holmes was the beginning of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
new point of view in the dealing
with the social welfare, which, he
said, has since written itself into
law. Justice Holmes made the remark,
&#147;The Fourteenth Amendment
does not enact Herbert Spencer&#146;s
Social Status,&#148; and Judge Cardozo
cites later cases in the Supreme
Court to the effect that &#147;A constitution
is not intended to embody a
particular economic theory, whether
of paternalism ... or of <i>laissez
faire</i>.&#148; It was by careful research
of the effect of long hours of
work for women that the change of
opinion was brought about.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a short and very interesting
lecture on precedents that
are of doubtful value questioning
what ought to be done with them.
He quotes President Roosevelt&#146;s
message to Congress, December 8,
1908, in which he says: &#147;The chief
lawmakers in our country may be,
and often are, the Judges, because
they are the final seal of authority....
The decisions of the Courts
on economic and social questions depend
upon their economic and social
philosophy; and, for the peaceful
progress of our people during the
Twentieth century, we shall owe
most to those Judges who hold a
Twentieth century economic and social
philosophy and not a long and
out-grown philosophy which was itself
the product of primitive economic
conditions.&#148; This aroused
at the time, he says, a storm of
criticism and betrayed ignorance of
the nature of the judicial process,
but the author said he had no quarrel
with the doctrine that Judges
ought to be in sympathy with the
spirit of their times. Yet this does
carry us very far upon our road to
the truth. The spirit of the age, as
it is revealed to each of us, is only
too often only the spirit of the
group in which the accidents of
birth, or education, or fellowship
have given us a place. No effort or
revolution of mind will overthrow
utterly and at all times the empire
of these unconscious loyalties.</p>

<p class="indent">The relation of the law to the
economic and social progress is of
great importance at this time, and it
is well for us to have the help of
this thoughtful and suggestive discussion
by an experienced and conscientious
Judge.</p>

<h3>OBITUARIES.</h3>

<h4>Mr. Thomas W. Randall</h4>

<p class="indent">Mr. Thomas William Randall,
long prominent as a lawyer in Paterson,
died at his residence at Upper
Preakness, a few miles from
that city, on Feb. 9, 1922, after a
long illness. Up until a few days
of his death he expected to live at
least through the coming Summer,
but the final end came with little
warning.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Randall was born at Slough,
in Buckinghamshire, England, about
twenty miles from London, near the
historic Windsor Castle and famous
Stoke Pogis church, on June 24,
1853, and is a descendant of some of
the most substantial and oldest families
in that locality. He arrived in
the United States, with his parents,
on June 8, 1866, sailing from London,
and resided first in Franklin
township, Bergen county, and later
at Hawthorne, in Passaic county,
until he entered upon the study of
his profession. He first studied law
in the office of Judge Hopper, in
Paterson, and afterwards with
Messrs. Pennington &amp; DeWitt, of
Newark, and also attended the Columbia
Law School in New York.
He was admitted to the New Jersey
Bar at the June Term of the Supreme
Court in 1877, and, after
spending some time abroad, came to
Paterson and entered upon the practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
of law, in which he was actively
engaged ever after until his last
illness. He became a counselor at
the February Term, 1889.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Randall took no active part
in politics, and never held a political
office; he had no liking for mere
partisanship. His practice was large
in the Orphans&#146; Court and in Chancery
proceedings, as he settled many
estates. He was a Special Master
of the Court of Chancery and as
such many matters of reference
were heard by him, and always with
promptness and efficiency. He was
also a Supreme Court Commissioner.
He was counsel for many of
the old Passaic families and for
various corporations. In the great
Paterson fire he lost every thing in
his office except what was in his
safe. He was an extensive reader
of good books and had an excellent
memory, a refined taste and the best
of habits. He had none of the common
vices of the day.</p>

<p class="indent">For many years Mr. Randall was
a member of the Second Presbyterian
Church. He served there on
the Board of Trustees and was also
a member of the Session. Mr. Randall
served the Second Church in a
legal capacity without cost to the
congregation and was always glad
to give legal advice to the poor in
need of it. He also served for many
years on the Board of Trustees of
the New Jersey Presbytery and was
known by every clergyman in that
Presbyterian body. He was seldom
absent at a stated meeting.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Randall was also the recognized
friend of the Young Men&#146;s
Christian Association and his services
in legal transactions were also
at the disposal of the Board of Managers.
He was counsel for the
Young Women&#146;s Christian Association
and served as a member of the
Investment Committee, with other
prominent men of the city.</p>

<p class="indent">When in 1886 the people of the
People&#146;s Park District appealed to
the late Dr. Charles D. Shaw and
the elders of the Second Presbyterian
Church for the establishment of
a Sunday School in that district of
the city, Mr. Randall was one of the
most interested members of the Session
in the movement to that end.
Through the aid extended on behalf
of the plan the Sunday School was
opened a few weeks after the request
was considered, and Mr. Randall
became the superintendent. He
frequently referred to that service
as one of the happy experiences of
his life. Later the school movement
grew into the establishment
of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian
Church, now one of the most
thriving congregations in the city,
under the pastorate of the Rev.
Franklin J. Miller. Mr. Randall
frequently visited the People&#146;s Park
church and school to note the progress
of the work he had a prominent
part in starting. He was
also interested in the St. Augustine
Presbyterian Church, and in establishing
headquarters for the colored
men on Governor street.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Randall was a Christian citizen
and was concerned in the welfare
of Paterson. He was a member
of the Passaic County Bar Association,
a director of the Paterson
Building and Loan Association, and
was identified with the old Board of
Trade. When the centennial celebration
of Paterson was held in
1892 he was one of the hundred
prominent men of the city selected
to plan for that big event.</p>

<p class="indent">For several years before his death
Mr. Randall was a member of the
Church of the Redeemer.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Randall was specially fond
of his native England, and made
various journeys to that county. The
Editor of this Journal has special
cause to know of his interest in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
travel and fine qualities as a traveler,
having been in his company
abroad in 1898, 1903, 1907 and
1910, in some of which occasions he
extended his trip to France, Switzerland,
Italy, Germany and Holland;
also to Ireland and Scotland.
In 1910 he saw the Passion Play.
He was also a frequent visitor to
Lake Mohonk. From its beginning
he was a patron and valued friend
of this Journal, frequently sending
to it copies of legal articles from
English newspapers and occasionally
contributing to its pages. The article
we shall publish in our next issue,
entitled &#147;A Letter to Portia,&#148;
was received from him only a few
days before his death, as were some
notes concerning the death of his
friend, Mr. Robert Hopper, also of
the Paterson Bar.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1879 Mr. Randall married
Miss Jennie S. Perry, a well known
and highly esteemed teacher in the
Paterson Public Schools, and at one
time principal of School Number
Two. Mrs. Randall died in 1912.
There survives one son, Edmund
Brown Randall, who is now the
Judge of the Paterson District
Court. A brother of Thomas W.,
Mr. Richard Randall, also a member
of the Paterson Bar, died Oct. 16,
1913.</p>

<h4>Col. E. Livingston Price</h4>

<p class="indent">Colonel Edward Livingston
Price, for 56 years past a member
of the Essex County Bar, died at his
home, 112 Bruen street, Newark,
on February 4, from a heart attack,
after an illness of about one year.</p>

<p class="indent">Colonel Price was born in New
York City Dec. 20, 1844, being a
brother to former Governor Rodman
M. Price, and a son of Francis
and Maria Louisa (Hart) Price of
New York City. He received his
education at Dr. Cattell&#146;s Edgehill
School, Princeton; Dr. Woodhull&#146;s
School, Freehold, and Dr. John F.
Pingry&#146;s School, then in Newark
and now in Elizabeth. He would
have gone to college had it not been
for the outbreak of the Civil War.
He entered the Union Army in
April, 1861, when he was sixteen,
as Second Lieutenant of Company
E, 74th Regiment, New York Volunteers,
having been unable to get
a commission in New Jersey. Shortly
afterward he was promoted to
First Lieutenant. In this capacity
he served from July, 1861, to April,
1862, when Major General Hooker
placed him on his personal staff as
Ordinance officer of the Third
Army Corps, &#147;Hooker&#146;s Division.&#148;
As Ordinance officer he served at
the siege of Yorktown, Va., and
during the whole of the peninsular
campaign. In August, 1862, he became
Major of his old Regiment,
the 74th New York, which he commanded
through Pope&#146;s campaign in
Virginia, in the battles of Bristow
Station, Second Manassas and
Chantilly. His promotion to the
Colonelcy of the 145th New York
Volunteers took place on February
18, 1863. He served with this Regiment
until January, 1864, taking
part in the battles of Chancellorsville
and Gettysburg.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the War he studied
law with the late U. S. Justice Joseph
Bradley, and was admitted as
a New Jersey attorney at the June
Term, 1866, but did not become
counselor until February, 1879. He
also became admitted to the various
United States Courts. He became,
in Newark, an active lawyer not
only but a strong political speaker
and manager, and was long chairman
of the Essex County Democratic
Committee and, for a time,
of the State Democratic Committee.
His ability as an organizer and his
forcefulness as a speaker made him
a powerful factor in moulding sentiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
in party conventions. His tall
figure and military bearing added
their effect. In the latter years of
his political activity he was familiarly
referred to as the &#147;Old War
Horse of the Democracy.&#148; As a
lawyer he ranked high in municipal
practice. He was counsel for the
city of Newark and various outlying
townships and for many of the
Boards in Newark.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1865, before he became of age,
he accepted a nomination for Assembly
from Essex county and was
sworn into office just after he
rounded his twenty-first year. He
was re-elected in 1867. As a legislator
he applied his active intelligence
to a study of the needs of
his constituents and of the State in
general and was the author of many
laws now on the statute books. In
later life Colonel Price bought a
farm near Branchville, Sussex county,
and spent much of his time there.</p>

<p class="indent">On June 1, 1864, Colonel Price
married Emma, daughter of William
and Mary Ann Marriott of
Newark. On April 27, 1887, he
was married again, the second wife
being Frederica Theresa, daughter
of Edward C. and Eva Elizabeth
Eberhardt of Newark. His surviving
children are a son, Frank M.
Price, who lives at the Price home,
and two daughters, Mrs. Frances
Maria Josephine Spear, wife of Edwin
M. Spear of Trenton, and Mrs.
Marion White, a widow, also of
Trenton. Edward Livingston Price,
the eldest son, died three years ago.
The eldest daughter, Marie Louise
Jones, died in Kansas City, Mo.</p>

<h4>Mr. Charles J. Roe</h4>

<p class="indent">Mr. Charles J. Roe, of the Jersey
City Bar, died in Faith Hospital,
St. Petersburg, Florida, on Feb.
10th. For some time past he had
not been in good health, and he
went South the latter end of January
to seek improvement. Soon after
his arrival there he became
worse and entered the hospital
where he died. In Jersey City he
had recently made his home, for
himself and wife, in the Fairmount
Hotel on the Boulevard.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Roe was the son of Charles
Roe and Elizabeth Ann (Coult)
Roe, and was born in Sussex county,
Sept. 11, 1850. His father was
the surrogate of that county for
three terms (1863-'78) and then
opened a drug store in Newton. The
son obtained his preparatory education
at Chester Institute and Newton
Collegiate Institute; then entered
Princeton College and was
graduated therefrom in 1870, in the
same class as Chief Justice Gummere
and ex-Judge George M. Shipman
of Belvidere. He then studied
law with the late Levi Shepherd of
Newton, and became an attorney at
the June Term, 1873, and a counselor
three years later. He practiced
very successfully in Newton
until 1894, a portion of the time
having a law partner, Mr. Frank
Shepherd; at the last named date,
he removed to Jersey City. Recently
he has had, as a law partner, J.
Haviland Tompkins, the firm being
Roe &amp; Tompkins. Mr. Roe was an
Advisory Master of the Court of
Chancery and Supreme Court Commissioner.
His practice was a general
one, but he somewhat specialized
in Chancery work. He was
recognized as an able attorney, of
scholarly instincts, being learned not
only in his profession but in the arts
and sciences. He knew some foreign
languages and had traveled extensively
in Europe as well as in
this country.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Roe married Margaret,
daughter of James F. and Sarah
(Northrup) Martin, and is survived
by his wife, and his sister,
Mrs. John R. Hardin of Newark.</p>
